      You have heard about {'GSCoin\'s'} core principles and why GSCoin is so great.
      But where does GSCoin come from?
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      One of the core developers of GBP (Good Boy Points) was frustrated
      that as GBP grew, it was a non-cryptocurrency with principles that changed
      weekly, daily, and sometimes even by the minute. The leadership of GBP was
      destabilizing their own currency by a lack of focused principles. The direction
      of GBP was not in the best interest of the real users of the coin. An opaque system, forgetting {'it\'s'}
      users, without security considerations would not hold up at web-scale even
      if GBP did catch on (which it {'didn\'t'} obvi).
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefor in 2018, this core developer came up with the idea of 3 main
      principles to realign a new currency for the future. In addition, without
      the existing technical debt and legacy physical design GSCoin could be
      architectured from the ground up to be web-scale. And thus, GSCoin was born.
