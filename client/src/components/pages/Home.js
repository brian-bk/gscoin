    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <p>
      The creationg of GSCoin is based on principles, which means that you can trust 
      your money is safe. Here are the core principles that guide the community and 
      development around GSCoin.
    </p>
    <h4>Transparent</h4>
    <p>
      The fundamental principle of GSCoin is transparency. All wallets are 100% visible 
      and saved in a secure cloud-hosted solution all of the time. Anyone can check 
      out their standing and compare between other wallets so that everything is transparent.
    </p>
    <h4>User-Driven Community</h4>
    <p>
      GSCoin relies on the community, and as such the development of GSCoin of the future
      is always about expanding and reaching out to our users. We take the user-experience
      at GSCoin very seriously.
    </p>
    <h4>Secure</h4>
    <p>
      Security of a non-crypto cryptocurrency is a
      &nbsp;
      <span className="font-italic">must</span>.
      &nbsp;
      There are competing non-crypto currencies that do not hold this same principle,
      and can not ensure that bad-actors do not take advantage of a flawed system.
      But with GSCoin you can always be assured that your wallet and GSCoins are safe.
